Project 3
LGBT Rights Festival, "Bloom in the Theater", on Dec 8th 9th 10th in The Great Star Theater.

# project overview
I am passionate about supporting LGBTQ+ rights because everyone deserves to live and love without discrimination. LGBTQ+ rights need to be protected to ensure that no one is discriminated against based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. One organization that stands out is The Asian Pride Project which provides support for LGBTQ+ Asian with short film and image, art from their come out story for other people in the community raise more awareness for LGBTQ+ in Asian community and other poeple. I believe that I can contribute to this change by raising awareness of LGBTQ+ issues and creating a safe and supportive environment. I'm using the color in the flag to create my logo into a flower which I pick for my Festival name, "Bloom in the Theater". My festival also is locate inside of the theater in Chinatown, San Francisco.
